# airbnb-clone-project
## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on building a scalable full-stack web application while deepening understanding of backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.  

This project also emphasizes **collaborative workflows**, **CI/CD integration**, and **best practices in software engineering**, helping learners gain hands-on experience in real-world development environments.

## Project Goals
- Master collaborative development using GitHub and industry-standard workflows.  
- Design and document scalable backend architecture and relational database schemas.  
- Implement secure APIs with authentication and authorization.  
- Explore integration of modern technologies like **Django, MySQL, and GraphQL**.  
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.  
- Strengthen project documentation and planning for effective teamwork.  

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **API:** REST & GraphQL  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or similar tools)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## Team Roles

- **Business Analyst (BA):**  
  Engages with stakeholders to understand the requirements of a booking platform like Airbnb. Translates these needs into functional specifications, ensuring that features such as property listings, booking management, and secure transactions align with user expectations.

- **Product Owner (PO):**  
  Defines and prioritizes the project backlog. Ensures that critical features such as user authentication, booking workflows, and payment handling are delivered in alignment with business goals and provide maximum value to end users.

- **Product Manager (PM):**  
  Sets the overall vision and roadmap for the Airbnb Clone. Coordinates cross-functional teams, balances stakeholder requirements with technical feasibility, and ensures timely delivery of milestones such as database integration, API security, and CI/CD setup.

- **UI/UX Designer:**  
  Designs intuitive interfaces for hosts and guests. Responsible for wireframes and prototypes that ensure smooth navigation when browsing properties, booking stays, or managing reservations, while keeping user experience at the core.

- **Software Architect:**  
  Defines the technical architecture of the project. Chooses frameworks like Django for backend, MySQL for database management, and GraphQL for API queries. Ensures the system is scalable, secure, and can handle real-world complexity similar to Airbnb.

- **Software Developer:**  
  Implements the application features. Backend developers build APIs for property listings, user authentication, and booking flows, while frontend developers (if included) integrate UI components with the backend to provide a seamless user experience.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:**  
  Tests features such as booking confirmation, user authentication, and database interactions to ensure the system behaves correctly. Validates that requirements documented by the BA and PO are met before features are released.

- **Test Automation Engineer:**  
  Builds automated test scripts to verify critical workflows like user login, booking reservations, and payment simulations. Helps maintain quality during continuous integration by catching bugs early.

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  Sets up and manages CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions. Automates deployments, containerizes the application with Docker, and ensures reliable performance of the project across development and production environments.

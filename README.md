## Database Design

The Airbnb Clone Project database is structured around key entities that manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments.  
Each entity has essential fields to support the core functionality of the application.

### Entities and Fields

- **Users**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each user  
  - `name`: Full name of the user  
  - `email`: User’s email address (used for login)  
  - `role`: Identifies if the user is a host or guest  

- **Properties**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each property  
  - `title`: Short description or name of the property  
  - `location`: Address or city where the property is located  
  - `price_per_night`: Cost of booking per night  
  - `host_id`: References the user who owns the property  

- **Bookings**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each booking  
  - `user_id`: References the guest making the booking  
  - `property_id`: References the property being booked  
  - `start_date`: Booking start date  
  - `end_date`: Booking end date  

- **Reviews**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each review  
  - `user_id`: References the guest who wrote the review  
  - `property_id`: References the property being reviewed  
  - `rating`: Numeric score given to the property  
  - `comment`: Feedback from the guest

  - `id`: Unique identifier for each payment  
  - `booking_id`: References the booking being paid for  
  - `amount`: Payment amount  
  - `status`: Payment status (completed, pending, failed)  

### Relationships
- A **User** can be both a **Host** (owning multiple properties) and a **Guest** (making multiple bookings).  
- A **Property** belongs to a single **User** (host), but can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.  
- A **Booking** is made by a **User** (guest) for a specific **Property**.  
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**.  
- A **Review** is written by a **User** (guest) for a specific **Property** after a booking.  


## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that replicate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. Each feature plays a vital role in delivering a seamless user experience while supporting business requirements.

- **User Management**  
  Enables users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. It also distinguishes between hosts, who list properties, and guests, who make bookings.  

- **Property Management**  
  Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings with details such as location, price, and availability. This ensures guests have accurate information when browsing for accommodations.  

- **Booking System**  
  Facilitates guests in reserving properties by selecting dates and confirming availability. It ensures accurate tracking of start and end dates to avoid double bookings.  

- **Review System**  
  Provides guests the ability to leave ratings and feedback for properties they have stayed in. This builds trust in the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions.  

- **Payment Integration**  
  Handles secure transactions linked to bookings, including tracking payment status (completed, pending, or failed). This ensures financial accountability between guests and hosts.  

- **Security & Authentication**  
  Implements robust authentication, authorization, and data protection measures. This feature safeguards sensitive information like passwords, payments, and booking details.  

- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**  
  Automates deployment and testing processes using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker. This improves development efficiency and ensures stable releases.  


## API Security

Security is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone Project to protect sensitive data, ensure trust, and maintain the integrity of the platform. The following measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**  
  Ensures that only verified users can access the platform by requiring secure login credentials. This protects against unauthorized access to accounts and personal information.

- **Authorization**  
  Controls what resources users can access based on their role (e.g., guest, host, or admin). This prevents unauthorized operations, such as a guest trying to manage another host’s property.

- **Data Encryption**  
  Sensitive information such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted in storage and during transmission. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be misused.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Restricts the number of API requests a user can make within a certain time frame. This protects the system against abuse, brute force attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

- **Input Validation**  
  All user-provided data will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection-based attacks.

- **Secure Payments**  
  Payment transactions will be handled with additional layers of security, including tokenization and compliance with industry standards (e.g., PCI DSS). This ensures financial data remains protected.
